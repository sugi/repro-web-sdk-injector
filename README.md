# Repro WebSDK Injector

Run Repro Web SDK on ANY wabsite.

## Install

TODO:

You can install via Chrome webstore.


## Develop with Webpack auto-reload and HRM
To make your workflow much more efficient this boilerplate uses the [webpack server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) to development (started with `npm run server`) with auto reload feature that reloads the browser automatically every time that you save some file o your editor.

You can run the dev mode on other port if you want. Just specify the env var `port` like this:

```
$ PORT=6002 npm run start
```

## Packing
After the development of your extension run the command

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```
Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.

## Secrets
If you are developing an extension that talks with some API you probably are using different keys for testing and production. Is a good practice you not commit your secret keys and expose to anyone that have access to the repository.

To this task this boilerplate import the file `./secrets.<THE-NODE_ENV>.js` on your modules through the module named as `secrets`, so you can do things like this:

_./secrets.development.js_

```js
export default { key: "123" };
```

_./src/popup.js_

```js
import secrets from "secrets";
ApiCall({ key: secrets.key });
```
:point_right: The files with name `secrets.*.js` already are ignored on the repository.
